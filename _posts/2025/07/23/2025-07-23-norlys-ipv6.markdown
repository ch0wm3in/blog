## Introduction

Recently I was forced by my employer to move to a new ISP; reluctantly I did so because internet is not cheap in this day and age.

Not much was disclosed about the new ISP, other than it had to happen and we could not choose freely from the market anymore as was the case before.
Lo and behold it was Norlys, the ISP everyone loves to bash...

Much can be said about the ISP, and I will keep my own opinions to myself.
But what was most annoying for me was the shift from an ISP who supported native IPv6 (on fiber)
to one that did not seem to support it at first glance (or at least won't admit it's a thing?)

Looking at <https://ipv6-adresse.dk/> (Unofficial Danish IPv6 provider dictionary)
they will state that they have been told that Norlys supports it partially, especially on fiber.
Many comments on GitHub (for the site's open source maintenance) about Norlys or subsidiaries will state the opposite

## The technical details from my point of view

So just a quick recap: I have Norlys on fiber out in the western part of Denmark, more specifically on the [RAH Fiber-optics ring](https://rah-fiber.dk/).
It's provided through my employer, but works as any normal private connection to my understanding.

IPv6 is possible, even with non-ISP issued equipment.
Or maybe some places but not all? Again it seems that it's one big mystery about Norlys's IPv6 support, but one thing is for sure: I have it and it's through Norlys.

One evening I was bored, and tried enabling DHCPv6 on my WAN interface just to see if I got any address. Previously I had Kviknet, which was merged with EWII where a /48 prefix was delegated via this with PD ia-pd.
Rightfully so, I did actually get one, that was also public: `2a13:8a02:0:7::4aa4`

This got me more invested. I decided to do a PCAP dump on WAN to see what was going on and get the DHCPv6 packages.
Looking at the DHCPv6 Reply, it became more clear. (DHCPv6 Reply XID packet below)

            Prefix address: 2a13:8a02:3047:e400::

```

Looking at the above, one can see that I get the `Identity Association for Non-temporary Address` a /128 for routing on my WAN interface, and then the actual PD `Identity Association for Prefix Delegation` for assigning my internal devices.
A /56 `2a13:8a02:3047:e400::`

At my home I use pfSense. No special options were enabled besides DHCPv6 on WAN and then the /56 on the option `DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation size` (used for tracking of interfaces).
It seems that the lease of the /56's are dynamic and that a simple restart will get you a new one (not 100% sure about this), so it's not a static range you get, which means that you will need to have inside interfaces use "Track interface" (pfSense terminology perhaps?) <https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/interfaces/configure-ipv6.html#track-interface>

Anyhow, it means to use the PD dynamically from the WAN interface and dynamically apply it to your DHCPv6/SLAAC/or whatever you use, on the inside if need be for later dynamic retrieval of IPv6 addresses for your devices.

## Optional (Not sure if this is needed)

This rule i put in, as it seems to be common denominator amongst many other IPv6 ready DHCPv6 using ISP's, but not sure if it's needed
![norlys-ipv6-rule](norlys-ipv6-rule.png)
If nothing else, it can be used to allow pings to all IPv6 addresses.
